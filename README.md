# CF.Bonsai

This repository contains Bonsai workflows examples for [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) created at the Champalimaud Foundation. These workflows are used to demonstrate the capabilities of Bonsai and to provide examples for users to build their own workflows.

It contains some utility packages for Bonsai and has support assets that were used in the different courses and workshops that were given at the Champalimaud Foundation.
