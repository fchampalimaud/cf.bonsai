Harp is a standard for asynchronous real-time data acquisition and experimental control in neuroscience. It includes specifications for a lightweight and versatile binary communication protocol, a set of common registers for microcontroller firmware, and a clock synchronization protocol.

The Harp ecosystem currently includes devices to configure, control, and collect data from a wide range of peripheral devices such as cameras, LEDs, nosepokes, and motors. Combining Harp devices is an easy way to extend experimental setup functionality with integrated timestamp synchronisation across devices.

Harp is being developed as a cross-institutional collaboration to develop an ecosystem of high-performance devices that make it easy for scientists to synchronize and extend the functionality of their setups.
