## Welcome

Wecome to CF.Bonsai, a website from the [Champalimaud Foundation](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/) that contains annotated examples of recurring neuroscience tasks programmed in [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/). Many of these examples make use of the [Harp](https://harp-tech.org/articles/about.html) hardware protocol to interface with a variety of peripheral devices.


## Getting started
Start by installing the necessary Bonsai and Harp software from the Getting Started menu on the left panel. Then, find your example of choice, and follow the instructions to run it. Every example can be copy directly to Bonsai, and it is accompanied by a set of annotations that interpret the most relevant parts of the code. If the example involves hardware (as those of harp) additional electrical diagrams are provided with the necessary connections between the components. 

## Bonsai

Bonsai is an open-source visual language for reactive programming. It is lightweight and easy to use with a variety of packages and modules for interfacing with hardware and for real-time processing and manipulation of data streams.

More information about Harp can be found at [bonsai-rx.org](https://bonsai-rx.org/).

## Harp

Harp is an open-source standard for asynchronous real-time data acquisition and experimental control in neuroscience.The Harp ecosystem currently includes devices to configure, control, and collect data from a wide range of peripheral devices such as cameras, LEDs, nosepokes, and motors.
