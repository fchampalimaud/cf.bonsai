# ToList 

## Summary
This example demonstrates how to pack the elements of a stream into a list, once the stream terminates using [*ToList*](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Reactive.ToList.html)

## Details
1. Generates a counter that starts at 0 and gets incremented every 200ms.
2. Terminates the stream once 5 events have been generated.
3. Packs the 5 elements generated into a list.
4. Gets the first element of the list (index=0).
5. Gets the last element of the list (index=4).
6. Prevents Bonsai from terminating when all the elements of the list have been emitted.

## Visualization
Visualize the output of the *Timer*, *ToList* and *Index* nodes using the ObjectTextVisualizer enlarged, such that all the elements generated by each node can be observed. Also, make the visualizers are all open at the start of the program so that no element is left out.
