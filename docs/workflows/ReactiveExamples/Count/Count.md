## Summary
This example demonstrates how to get number of elements generated by a stream once it has terminated using the [Count](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Reactive.Count.html) operator.

## Details
1. Generates an event every 200ms.
2. Terminates the stream once 5 events have been generated.
3. Counts the number of events generaged by the stream. Double-click on this node to visualize its output using the ObjectTextVisualizer. Make sure the visualizer is at the start of the program.
4. Prevents Bonsai from terminating once the five events have been generated, and in doing so, it allows the user to visualize the output of the *Count* node.
