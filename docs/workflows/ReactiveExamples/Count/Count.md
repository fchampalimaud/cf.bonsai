## Workflow

![Example](~/workflows/ReactiveExamples/Count/Count.bonsai)
:::

## Details
1. Generates an event every 100ms.
2. Terminates the stream once 5 events have been generated.
3. Counts the number of events generaged by the stream.
4. Prevents Bonsai from terminating once the five events have been generated, and in doing so, it allows the user to visualize the output of the Count node.
