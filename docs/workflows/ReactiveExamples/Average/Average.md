# Average

## Summary
This example demonstrates how to get the average of elements generated by a stream once it has terminated using the [Average](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Reactive.Average.html) operator.

:::

## Details
1. Generates an event every 200ms.
2. Terminates the stream once 5 events have been generated.
3. Averages all the values generaged by the stream. 
4. Prevents Bonsai from terminating once the five events have been generated, and in doing so, it allows the user to visualize the output of the *Average* node. 

## Visualization
Visualize the output of both the *Timer* and *Average* nodes using the ObjectTextVisualizer enlarged.
