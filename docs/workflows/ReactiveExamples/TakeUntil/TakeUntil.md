# Take Until

## Summary
This example demonstrates how to control the end of a stream using the *TakeUntil* operator. Here, the workflow terminates after a key has been pressed.

## Workflow

:::workflow
![Example](~/workflows/ReactiveExamples/TakeUntil/TakeUntil.bonsai)
:::

## Details
1. Generates an event every second.
2. Propagates the events generated by the *Timer* until the 'S' key is pressed; when this happens, it emits an *OnComplete* message that terminates the preceding workflow.
3. Terminates the main workflow when *OnComplete* message is received.

## Visualization
Visualize the output of the *TakeUntil* node using ObjectTextVisualized enlarged, such that multiple events can be observed.
