## Summary
This example demonstrates how to unpack the elements of an array using [*Concat*](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Reactive.Concat.html)

## Details
1. Gets the directories under the C:\ drive (change the Path property for other parent directories).
2. Converts the string array with the directories in (1) to individual strings, each containing the path to one of the directories. 
3. Prevents Bonsai from terminating when all the elements of the array have been emitted.

## Visualization
Visualize the output of the *GetDirectories* and *Concat* nodes using ObjectTextVisualizer enlarged, such that all the elements generated by each node can be observed. Also, make the visualizers are all open at the start of the program so that no element is left out.
