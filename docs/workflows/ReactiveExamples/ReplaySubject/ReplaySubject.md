# Replay Subject

## Summary
This example demonstrates how to get all the data from a stream that is already running, including values that were emited before we subscribed to the stream, using the [*ReplaySubject*](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Reactive.ReplaySubject.html) node.

## Workflow

## Details
1. Creates a *ReplaySubject*, named *MySubject*, with the values of a counter that starts with value 0 gets incremented every 0.2s.
2. Subscribes *MySubject* when 'A' is pressed. Double-click on this node to visualize its content and compare it with that of the *Timer* node. You should see that the when 'A' is pressed, all the values generated by the *Timer* node will appear in the *SubscribeWhen* node, including those that were generated before the keypress.


## Visualization
Vizualize the node outputs using the *ObjectTextVizualizer* with an expanded window for each node to be able to better compare their contents.

## Follow up
You can compare this with other *Subject* types: [*PublishSubject*](../PublishSubject/PublishSubject.html) and [*BehaviorSubject*](../BehaviorSubject/BehaviorSubject.html).
