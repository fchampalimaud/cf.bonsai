## Details
1. Generates an event every 200ms.
2. Terminates the stream once 5 events have been generated.
3. Emits the maximum value generaged by the stream. 
4. Prevents Bonsai from terminating once the five events have been generated, and in doing so, it allows the user to visualize the output of the *Max* node.


## Visualization
Visualize the output of both the *Timer* and *Max* nodes using the ObjectTextVisualizer enlarged.
